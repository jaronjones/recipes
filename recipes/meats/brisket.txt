Smoked Brisket Recipe on a Traeger Grill
Ingredients
Whole brisket (12-15 lbs, with fat cap)
Your choice of brisket rub (commercial or homemade)
Beef broth (optional, for spritzing)
Apple cider vinegar (optional, for spritzing)
Brown sugar (optional)
Dijon mustard or olive oil (for binding the rub)
Equipment
Traeger grill
Meat thermometer
Aluminum foil or butcher paper
Spray bottle (for spritzing)
Sharp knife
Preparation
Trim the Brisket:

Trim the fat cap on the brisket to about ¼ inch thickness.
Remove any large pieces of hard fat or silver skin.
Apply the Rub:

Coat the brisket lightly with Dijon mustard or olive oil to help the rub stick.
Generously apply your brisket rub all over the meat, ensuring even coverage.
Smoking Process
Preheat the Traeger:

Preheat your Traeger grill to 225°F (107°C) for 15 minutes with the lid closed.
Smoke the Brisket:

Place the brisket on the grill, fat side up.
Smoke the brisket until it reaches an internal temperature of about 160°F (71°C). This usually takes about 6-8 hours, depending on the size of the brisket.
Spritzing (Optional):

If you choose to spritz, mix equal parts beef broth and apple cider vinegar in a spray bottle.
Spritz the brisket every hour after the first 3 hours of smoking.
Wrap the Brisket:

Once the brisket reaches 160°F (71°C), wrap it in butcher paper or aluminum foil.
Before wrapping, you can add a layer of brown sugar for added sweetness if desired.
Continue Cooking:

Return the wrapped brisket to the grill.
Continue to cook until the internal temperature reaches between 200-205°F (93-96°C). This can take an additional 3-4 hours.
Rest the Brisket:

Remove the brisket from the grill and let it rest for at least 1 hour before slicing. Keep it wrapped during this time.
Serving
Slice the Brisket:
Slice against the grain for maximum tenderness.
Serve with your favorite barbecue sides and sauces.
Tips
Temperature Monitoring: Use a meat thermometer to accurately track the brisket's internal temperature.
Patience is Key: The cooking time can vary based on the size and thickness of the brisket, as well as external factors like weather.
Resting Period: Don't skip the resting period; it allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, ensuring a moist and tender brisket.
Enjoy your smoked brisket! Remember, smoking is an art that requires patience and practice, so don't be discouraged if it takes a few tries to perfect.
